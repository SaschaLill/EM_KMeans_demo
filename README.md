The repository contains
* 2 Jupyter notebooks
* The Faithful dataset (272 rows, 2 columns)
* The iris dataset (150 rows, 4 columns)
* And some figures showing examplary results:

K-Means figures:
* Kmeans1.png: A full K-means run with K = 2
* Kmeans2.png: Another K-means run with K = 2
* Kmeans3.png: Another K-means run with K = 2
* Kmeans4.png: Another K-means run with K = 2
* Kmeans5.png: A full K-means run with K = 3
* Kmeans6.png: A full K-means run with K = 5
* Kmeans7.png: A full K-means run with K = 10
* Kmeans8.png: A full K-means run with K = 20
